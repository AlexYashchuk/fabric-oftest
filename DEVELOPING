Overview
++++++++

    The directory structure is currently:

     <oftest>
         `
         |-- oft
         |-- doc
         |-- src
         |   `-- python
         |       `-- oftest
         |-- tests
         |   `-- test cases
         `-- tools
             |-- munger
             `-- pylibopenflow

    The tools directory is what processes the OpenFlow header
    files to produce Python classes representing OpenFlow messages.
    The results are placed in src/python/oftest and currently
    include:

        message.py:      The main API providing OF message classes
        error.py:        Subclasses for error messages
        action.py:       Subclasses for action specification
        cstruct.py:      Direct representation of C structures in Python
        class_maps.py:   Addition info about C structures

    In addition, the following Python files are present in 
    src/python/oftest:

        controller.py:   The controller representation
        dataplane.py:    The dataplane representation
        action_list.py:  Action list class
        netutils.py:     e.g., set promisc on sockets
        ofutils.py:      Utilities related to OpenFlow messages
        oft_assert.py:   Test framework level assertion
        testutils.py:    Test utilities
        base_tests.py:   Base test classes

Important Notes
+++++++++++++++

    1.  If you change any of the code generation scripts in
    tools/munger/scripts you must re-run make -C tools/munger to
    regenerate the OpenFlow message classes.

Adding Your Own Test Cases
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    Check the online tutorial:  
        http://openflow.org/wk/index.php/OFTestTutorial

    It's suggested to use basic.py as example code for writing new tests.

    You can:

        * Add cases to an existing file
        * Add a new file

    If you add cases to an existing file, each case should be its own
    class.  It must inherit from unittest.TestCase or one of its 
    derivatives.  Most tests will inherit from oftest.base_tests.SimpleDataPlane.

    CONVENTIONS:

    The first line of the doc string for a file and for a test class is 
    displayed in the list command.  Please keep it clear and under 50
    characters.

Submitting Patches
++++++++++++++++++

    Send a pull request on GitHub to floodlight/oftest.

Other Info
++++++++++

    * Build doc with
      + cd <oftest>/tools/munger
      + make doc
    Places the results in <oftest>/doc/html
    If you have problems, check the install location doxypy.py and
    that it is set correctly in <oftest>/doc/Doxyfile

    * Run lint on sources
      + cd <oftest>/tools/munger
      + make lint
    Places results in <oftest>/lint/*.log
    The file controller.log currently has some errors indicated

To Do
+++++

    * Need to have an overview of the components of the test, how they
      connect and how they are managed by the test framework.
    * See the Regression Test component on trac:
      http://www.openflowswitch.org/bugs/openflow
      http://www.openflowswitch.org/bugs/openflow/query?component=Regression+test+suite

    * Make the framework work with OF versions other than 1.0?
